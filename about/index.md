This site is a low key blog with a focus on science and programming. In addition to the enjoyment of running a blog and server, writing articles helps to fully understand a topic. Explaining something is a good way to learn what you don't know.

The original name of the site was mxbutterfly, inspired by the magic emacs command "M-x butterfly", a joke originating from xkcd about the optimal way to write software (or do anything, really).

The site was founded by a couple fun scientists; one computer, one biomedical.
